                <p>
                    A deep dive into the science behind your favorite image manipulation techniques. Ever wonder what the exact math was to increase the contrast of an image? I've
                    made a program which mimics this popular effect using math generated from hours spent researching different imaging tools.

                <h1>Dartboard Probability Calculations</h1>
                <p>Who doesn't love math? This dartboard simulation calculates an array of possible outcomes given parameters defined by the user. It can be used in a variety of
                    statistical contexts to generate probability, statisical significance, and standard deviation.

                    Created a program which reads in the colors of real life objects and displays them on a laptop for categorization and manipulation. If you've ever wanted to know 
                    the exact color of your eyes, or if you've wanted to settle a debate about your favorite shirt being more indigo than it is violet, this program is for you.

                    I am currently seeking internships for the Summer of 2020. I'd love to connect and share my work as well as learn from industry professionals about exciting new 
                    ideas and techniques to research.
